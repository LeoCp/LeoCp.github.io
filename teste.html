    <h1>What is MongoDB?</h1>
    <p>
So what is MongoDB?


MongoDB as many things. But most of the features
and functionality of MongoDB rests on the fact that
it's a document database. When discussing MongoDB data
models, queries to MongoDB, and data stored in MongoDB, we
use JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation. This JSON document
provides an exampl that illustrates the type
of data MongoDB stores as a single record. Important advantages
of this design are that development teams can
design data models to support common data access patterns. For example, a team
building a news website can design their data model
so that the most frequently viewed pages may require only
a single query to the database, and can do this in an elegant way that is fully supported by MongoDB.

In this example, we're combining
copy, author info, tags, and comments to enable
rendering a news article with a single database query.


Contrast this with a relational
design, which would probably


require several
joins across tables,


or an ugly means of storing
multiple values in single table


fields.


Since MongoDB data
models are not


predicated on joining data
from multiple tables together,


it's much easier to
distribute, or shard, data


across multiple servers.


This means, in MongoDB, you
have a wide variety of options


when considering
database deployments


from many, inexpensive
commodity machines


to a few larger, more
powerful servers.


MongoDB natively
supports scaling out


through its sharding
feature, and does


so in a way that is abstracted
away from application logic.

So developers can
build their application


in a way that is agnostic about
the deployment model used.

Whether a single node, or a
few nodes, or hundreds of nodes


are used makes no difference
from the perspective


of the application.


In contrast, since joins
and multi-table transactions


are difficult to do in parallel,
for a relational system,


your best option is
usually scaling up,

acquiring increasingly expensive
hardware so that your data can

be served from a single server.


While not always true,
multi-table joins


and transactions are
typically not missed


in a MongoDB database, because
the schema design capabilities

support models that require
atomic reads and writes only to individual documents.


So in summary, MongoDB
enables application developers to design data models that make
sense for their applications. That is, those that efficiently
support common data access patterns. As we'll see as we move
through this course, MongoDB is designed to support agile software engineering practices and meet the scalability and performance needs of modern applications.
